 APP SUMMARY

My fundraiser Dapp, allows people and organizations to raise funds after some  disasater or for other financial needs. Donors make donations by sending ether to the contract address of the particuar fundraising campaign they choose to donate to. These people or organizations can then withdraw the amount raised in that campaign. This widthrawal action can only be performed by the creator of the fundraising campaign.  The creator of the campaign provides a beneficiary address when creating a new fundraising campaign. Fundsraised can only be withdrawn into the beneficiary address for that capaign but this address can be an address from any wallet provider or exchanger.
